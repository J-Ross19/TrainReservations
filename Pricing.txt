Total fare of a reservation:
$35 booking fee (bf) one way normal trip + fare of each and every ride/schedule of that reservation of course
$40 bf round trip + fare of each ride (2 rides at least one going and one coming)
$300 bf weekly pass (note for this its just a booking fee there are no rides you
		dont have to pay the fare of the schedule/ride, its like a season pass for 1 week)
$1000 bf monthly pass

for each ride fare is stored in schedule it points to, and there are 3 different fares in there: normal
child/senior and disabled. You pick one of them based on the isChildOrSenior and isDisabled booleans in ride
note both booleans cant be set at the same time
(when they are making their reservation, next to each ride make a radio button if they are a child/senior, disabled, or none)

economy class multiplies fare from a ride by *1, buisness by *1.5 and first by *2
