# TrainReservations

## Final group project for CS336 at Rutgers University

Group Members: Ronak Parikh, Joshua Ross, Srija Gottiparthi, Bridget Savage, James Hadley

We first created an [ER Diagram](./ER_Group11.pdf) together as a group

The implementation of the project was divided into 6 major parts and we divided the work accordingly:

1. Create accounts of users; login, logout. (Joshua and Ronak)
2. Browsing and search functionality (Bridget)
3. Reservations (James)
4. Messaging functions (Srija)
5. Admin functions (Ronak)
6. Customer representative (Joshua)

Our assumptions are listed [here](./Assumptions.txt)

You can access website credentials such as the project url, Amazon EC2, Apache Tomcat credentials, and Admin credentials [here](./README.txt)
